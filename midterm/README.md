# CS5510-Robot-Intelligence

This is our midterm for CS5510-Robot-Intelligence.  Most all scripts should install the required packages needed to execute, however its still recommended that you create your own python environment and install the required scripts there to prevent collissions and version mismatches. Some problems may not run at all if the required photos / images are not included.

We also provide a requirements.txt file for your convenience to install them all at a single time, rather than waiting for each one to finish in its own script.

Each question is separated into its own python notebook that can be ran as needed.  It's not recommmended to run many such as question 6 or some of the AI models as retraining may take a significant amount of time on some systems.
