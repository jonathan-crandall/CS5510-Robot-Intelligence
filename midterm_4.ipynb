The first equation derives the angular acceleration of the pole based on gravity, the current angle of the pole, our pushing force, the length of the pole, the mass of the pole and of the cart, and of the current angular velocity of the pole. The second equation derives the acceleration of the cart in the x-axis based on our pushing force, the mass of the the pole and of the cart, the length of the pole, the current angle of the pole, the angular velocity, and the angular acceleration as derived in the previous equation.\n",
