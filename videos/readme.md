# Vieo Info

Most videos titles should describe clearly enough the content, but heres a few extra information for each video.

- not enough cpu: This was a demonstration done on a laptop running the control server showing how slow processing speeds can affect the response time of the robot.  Recording screens + running the recogintion stack was too much for our current hardware to handle.
- Good1 is a demonstration of our robot finding and intercepting a ball
- ball tracking standalone: Highlights the internal camera's ability to track and place the ball relatively in the center of the screen, even with movement.
